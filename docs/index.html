<h1 id="introduction-to-the-wizardwrxoperatingparametermanager">Introduction to the WizardWrx.OperatingParameterManager</h1>

<p>I created the <strong>WizardWrx.OperatingParameterManager</strong> class library and NuGet
package to support data-driven parameter evaluation for Windows desktop programs
that target the Microsoft .NET Framework.</p>
<p>The libraries were compiled against versions 4.6.1 of the Microsoft .NET
Framework, and they are compatible with versions from 4.6.1 up. Version 7.3 or
later of the C# compiler is required to compile the library, which takes
advantage of generic <code>Enum</code> types.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>API Documentation</strong> link in the navigation bar at the top of this page
to display a summary of the classes, along with links to complete documentation
of the public constants, enumerations, and methods exposed by them.</p>
<h1 id="road-map">Road Map</h1>
<p>This class library evolves to acommodate needs as they arise in my development
work. Nevertheless, I have a road map, and it has a few well-marked stops.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>A NuGet Package</strong> is a certainty, as soon as I can find time to create it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Performance improvements in the internal data structures that give these
classes their magical powers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>
<p>Though I created this library to meet my individual development needs, I have
put a good bit of thought and care into its design. Moreover, since I will not
live forever, and I hope these libraries can outlive me, I would be honored to
add contributions from others to it, and eventually designate a new owner. My
expectations are relatively few, simple, easy to meet, and intended to preserve
the consistency of the code base and its API.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Naming Conventions</strong>: I use Hungarian notation. Some claim that it has
outlived its usefulness. I think it remains useful because it encodes data
about the objects to which the names are applied that follows them wherever they
go, and convey it without help from IntelliSense or extra eyeball exercise.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Coding Style</strong>: I have my editor set to leave spaces around every token.
This spacing has helped me quicly spot misplaced puncuation, such as the right
bracket that closes an array initializer that is in the wrong place, and it
makes mathematical expressions easier to read and mentally parse.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Comments</strong>: I comment liberally and very deliberately. Of particular
importance are the comments that I append to the bracket that closes a block. It
does either or both of two things: link it to the opening statement, and
document which of two paths an <strong>if</strong> statement is expected to follow most of
the time. When blocks get nested two, three, or four deep, they earn their keep.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Negative Conditions</strong>: I do my best to avoid them, because they almost
always cause confusion. Astute observers will notice that they occur from time
to time, because there are <em>a few cases</em> where they are <em>less</em> confusing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Array Initializers</strong>: Arrays that have more than a very few initializers,
or that are initialized to long strings, are laid out as lists, with line
comments, if necessary, that describe the intent of each item.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Format Item Lists</strong>: Lists of items that are paired with format items in
calls to <code>string.Format</code>, <code>Console.WriteLine</code>, and their relatives, are laid out
as arrays, even if there are too few to warrant one, and the comments show the
corresponding format item in context. This helps ensure that the items are
listed in the correct order, and that all format items are covered. This
practice has exposed countless bugs very early, when they are easy to correct.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symbolic Constants</strong>: I use symbolic constants to document what a literal
value means in the context in which it is used, and to disambiguate tokens that
are easy to confuse, suzh as <code>1</code> and <code>l</code> (lower case L), <code>0</code> and <code>o</code> (lower case O),
literal spaces (1 and 2 spaces are common), underscores, the number <code>-1</code>, and so
forth. Literals that are widely applicable are defined in a set of classes that
comprise the majority of the root <code>WizardWrx</code> namespace.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Argument Lists</strong>: I treat argument lists as arrays, and often comment each
argument with the name of the paramter that it represents. These lists help
guarantee that a long list of positional arguments is specified in the correct
order, especially when several are of the same type (e. g., two or more integer
arguments). This practice exposes bugs early, some subtle, when they are easy to
correct.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triple-slash Comments</strong>: These go on <em>everything</em>, even private members and
methods, so that everything supports IntelliSense, and it's easy to apply a tool
(I use DocFX.) to generate reference documentation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With respect to the above items, you can expect me to be a nazi, though I shall
endeavor to give contributors a fair hearing for a good case. Otherwise, please
exercise your imagination, and submit your pull requests. When I get NuGet
packages implemented, I'll take care of rolling the contributions into the
appropriate packages, and contributors will get prominent credit on the package
page in the official public repository. If you skim the headnotes of the code,
you will notice that I take great pains to give others credit when I icorporate
their code into my projects, even to the point of disclaiming copyright or
leaving their copyright notice intact. Along the same lines, the comments are
liberally sprinkled with references to articles and Stack Overflow discussions
that contributed to the work.</p>
